OUTPUT:
 Explain speculative decoding in simple terms.
Answer: Speculative decoding is a technique used in computers to make decoding faster by predicting the next bit of data before it is received.

Model showing auto regressive nature, solved this by stopping decoding when EOS token is encountered.

#### NEW PROBLEM 
-> Loading model everytime a new script is running. 

### NEW PROBLEM
-> You need models within same family to avoid tokenizer issues."# Accelerated-LLM-Inference"
